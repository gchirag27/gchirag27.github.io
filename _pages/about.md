I'm a **Master of Computing** student in Computer Science at the **National University of Singapore**, graduating in May 2026. My passion lies at the intersection of **AI/ML**, **distributed systems**, and **computational problem-solving**.

## What I'm Working On

🔬 Currently, I'm a **Data Science Intern at Danone**, where I'm building AI voice-assisted applications with Model Context Protocol and developing predictive models for infant health and nutrition.

💼 Previously, I spent 8 months as an **AI Software Engineer at HP Inc.**, where I increased operational productivity and AI adoption by 20% across 9+ countries in Greater Asia.

## My Background

I graduated from **Purdue University** with a B.S. in Computer Science and an Applied Math Minor (GPA: 3.71/4.0), where I was recognized with the **Top 100 Student Award** and the **International Jaguar Excellence Award**.

My experience spans:

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Deep learning, NLP, predictive modeling
- **Software Engineering**: Full-stack development, distributed systems, API design
- **Research**: Computational biology, mathematical modeling, finite element methods
