## Overview

**FixAI** is a prototype system that generates code from natural language descriptions while providing evidence of trustworthiness—a critical feature for ethical AI deployment.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language to Code**: Converts task descriptions into functional code implementations
- **Automatic Verification**: Built-in testing and verification to ensure generated code works correctly
- **Trustworthiness Evidence**: Provides transparency into the AI code generation process
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **0.889 pass@1** on HumanEval benchmark using ReAct framework

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Symbolic Execution Engine
- ReAct Framework
- NLP & Ethical AI Practices

## Technical Highlights

The project addresses the critical challenge of trust in AI-generated code. By implementing a Python symbolic execution engine, FixAI can:

1. **Generate Code**: Produce functional implementations from natural language specifications
2. **Verify Correctness**: Automatically test generated code against expected behaviors
3. **Provide Evidence**: Document the reasoning and verification steps for transparency

This approach supports ethical guidelines necessary in international AI policy and trust-building across organizational boundaries.
